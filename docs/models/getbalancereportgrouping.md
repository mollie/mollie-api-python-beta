# GetBalanceReportGrouping

You can retrieve reports in two different formats. With the `status-balances` format, transactions are grouped
by status (e.g. `pending`, `available`), then by transaction type, and then by other sub-groupings where
available (e.g. payment method).

With the `transaction-categories` format, transactions are grouped by
transaction type, then by status, and then again by other sub-groupings where available.

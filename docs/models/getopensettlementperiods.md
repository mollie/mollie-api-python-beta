# GetOpenSettlementPeriods

For bookkeeping purposes, the settlement includes an overview of transactions included in the settlement. These
transactions are grouped into 'period' objects â€” one for each calendar month.

For example, if a settlement includes funds from 15 April until 4 May, it will include two period objects. One for
all transactions processed between 15 April and 30 April, and one for all transactions between 1 May and 4 May.

Period objects are grouped by year, and then by month. So in the above example, the full `periods` collection will
look as follows: `{"2024": {"04": {...}, "05": {...}}}`. The year and month in this documentation are referred as `<year>` and `<month>`.

The example response should give a good idea of what this looks like in practise.
